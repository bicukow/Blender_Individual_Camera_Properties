The addon manages Scene, Render, and Resolution properties for each individual camera instance. By simply adjusting the render settings, these modifications will be automatically saved within the respective camera properties. Whenever you switch to a different active camera, the addon will automatically apply the previously saved parameters for that camera to the scene.
